PART A - IT Forensic Criminal Case
You are required to look at a real criminal case involving a digital device. See Appendix A
for a fictional example. There will be 7 different stories related to disk-based forensics:
● Story 0: Jewel Victoria GRIFFITHS - Drug Importation | Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
● Story 1: Sydney man jailed for online exploitation and extortion of children | Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
● Story 2: QLD man convicted for child pornography offences | Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
● Story 3: Paedophile jailed for 40 years for abusing children in Australia and Thailand | Commonwealth Director of
Public Prosecutions
● Story 4: Richard RAMOS - Child exploitation offences | Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
● Story 5: Luca SILVERII - Medicare fraud | Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
● Story 6: Record sentence for head administrator of paedophile site | Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
To determine which story you are working on, do MODULO 7 OPERATION on your
student ID. For example: 12345678 MOD 7 = 2. Therefore, the story that should be
investigated is Story 2. Mark deduction will be applied for incorrect Story choice.
1) Designing Questions: After researching about your story, design five questions
specific to the digital evidence (that a lead investigator would ask) on your case
that you (as a digital forensic examiner) need to answer by using digital forensic
techniques/tools/protocols. See sample questions for the sample fictitious story
in Appendix A.
(10 marks)
2) Forensically Sound Plan Design and Forensic Tools: In order to answer the
questions you have created in Part 1, design a forensically sound plan/protocol,
which will help you find the answers. The protocol should cover:
● Preparation, e.g. how you prepare yourself before going to the crime scene.
● Acquisition/Preservation, e.g. how would you acquire/preserve the
evidence such that you will not leave any potential evidence untouched;
how would you manage your time and devices.
● Examination/Analysis, e.g. how you examine and analyse the evidence
with the open-source and paid tools.

You also need to cover the following topics in your plan/protocol:
● What tools will you need to investigate the evidence?
● Describe the advantages and disadvantages of using the (non-)forensic
tools of your choice, e.g. free tools vs licensed ones.
● How will you use the tools to find evidence?
● Expected time and cost to find the answers.
(30 marks)
Your answer on this (entire Part A), which should appear in the form of a report should
not exceed 800 words. The word limit excludes tables, figures, and references. Please
